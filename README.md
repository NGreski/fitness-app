**GitFitness - ** 

GitFitness is a Web Application that allows users to track their fitness goals. There are several features that allow this to happen. Users can manually upload an activity that they did like running, biking or walking. Several metrics are included within the add activity page like time, distance, calories burned, date and difficulty level. These activities are then stored in a database and sent to other pages on our website. User's activities will be displayed on the calendar and on the activity page and the stats will go on the stats page.

Users can also sign up and create a profile with a picture and other information about themselves. There is also a goals page where users can write down their fitness goals. Most of these pages use local storage to display user's inputs, other than the activities using a database to store the information.

GitFitness' most impressive feauture is our distance tracker. You can go to the start page (track.html) and hit go to track distance and time, for a run or walk or anything you'd like to use it for. This distance tracker uses a JavaScript function called geolocation, to track the location of the user within the browser of their mobile device.
